<h1> Bayesian Hyperparameter optimization </h1>

This repo contains an implementation of Bayesian Optimization based on the Gaussian process. 
<br>
I have used [gp_minimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/#skopt.gp_minimize) package of the [Scikit-Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) library to implement this. The implementation uses an LSTM model that uses a stock price dataset.
